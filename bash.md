```


# Variables

- Declare variable having integer value
```bash
ivar=10
```

- Declare variable having character value
```bash
cvar='a'
```

- Declare variable having string
```bash
svar="bash"
```

# Arrays
There are two types of arrays

## Indexed
- Integers can be used to refernece an element
- Zero based
- Syntax: `declare -a array`


- Declare an empty list
```bash
declare -a arr=()

echo "Size of array: ${#arr[@]}"
```
> `Size of array: 0`


- Declare an array with two elements
```bash
declare -a arr
arr[0]="entry0"
arr[1]="entry1"

echo "Size of array: ${#arr[@]}"
```
> `Size of array: 2`


- Declare an array with two elements
```bash
declare -a arr=("entry0" "entry1")

echo "Size of array: ${#arr[@]}"
```
> `Size of array: 2`


- Declare an array with two elements
```bash
arr=("entry0" "entry1")
```
> `Size of array: 2`


- Append a new element to the array
```bash
declare -a arr=("entry0" "entry1")
arr+=("entry2")

echo "Size of array: ${#arr[@]}"
```
> `Size of array: 3`


- Declare an array: zero index based array
```bash
iarray=( 10 20 30 40 50 )
```

- Array manipulations
```bash
iarray=( 10 20 30 40 50 )

echo "Count: ${#iarray[@]}" # Show number of elements in the array
echo "Elems: ${iarray[@]}" # Show all elements of the array
echo "Sub elems: ${iarray[@]:1:3}" # Show all elements of the array b/w the range
```
> `Count: 5` \
`Elems: 10 20 30 40 50` \
`Sub elems: 20 30 40`


- Iterate over the array
```bash
for ((i=0; i < ${#iarray[@]}; ++i)); do
  echo "Index # $i: ${iarray[i]}"
done
```
> `Index # 0: 10` \
`Index # 1: 20` \
`Index # 2: 30` \
`Index # 3: 40` \
`Index # 4: 50`


- Remove a specific element from the array
```bash
iarray=( 10 20 30 40 50 )

unset iarray[2] # Remove element # 2
echo ${iarray[@]} # Show all elements of the array
```

- Assign sub-elements to a new array
```bash
iarray=( 10 20 30 40 50 )

iarr=("${iarray[@]:1:3}") # Assign elements # 1,2,3 of iarray to iarr
echo ${iarr[@]} # Show all elements of the array
```

> `20 30 40`


## Associative
- Use arbitrary strings
- Syntax: `declare -A array`

```bash
declare -A aarr
aarr[animal]=lion
aarr[location]=African
```

### Add new key
```bash
aarr+=([group]=Pride)
```

```bash
echo "Count: ${#aarr[@]}" # Show number of elements in the array
echo "Elems: ${aarr[@]}" # Show all elements of the array
```
> `Count: 3` \
`Elems: lion african pride`


- Iterate keys of the array
```bash
for key in "${!aarr[@]}"; do
  echo "Key # $key";
done
```
> `Key # animal` \
`Key # location` \
`Key # group`


- Show all keys
```bash
echo "${!aarr[@]}"
```
> `animal location group`


-  Iterate values of the array
```bash
for val in "${aarr[@]}"; do
  echo "Value # $val";
done
```
> `Value # lion` \
`Value # african` \
`Value # pride`


- Show all values
```bash
echo "${assArray1[@]}"
```
> `lion african pride`


- Iterate array in key-value pair
```bash
for key in "${!aarr[@]}"; do
 echo "$key: ${aarr[$key]}";
done
```
> `animal: lion` \
`location: african` \
`group: pride`

# Array 2D
```bash
declare -A matrix
matrix[0,0]='00'
matrix[0,1]='01'
matrix[1,0]='10'
matrix[1,1]='11'

num_rows=2
num_columns=2

for ((x=0;x<num_rows;x++)) do
  for ((y=0;y<num_columns;y++)) do
    echo "$x,$y = ${matrix[$x,$y]}"
  done
done
```
> `0,0 = 00` \
`0,1 = 01` \
`1,0 = 10` \
`1,1 = 11`


# Arithmetics

## Simple

- Different ways to perform calculation
```bash
x=2
y=10
echo $(( x + y )) # spaces does not matter
echo $((x+y)) # spaces does not matter
echo $(($x+$y)) # having $ for variable does not matter
```
> `12` \
`12` \
`12`

- Perform additional calculation
```bash
x=2
((x += 3))
echo x
```
> `5`

The same can be done for:
- Addition (`+`, `+=` )
- Subtraction (`-`, `-=`)
- Division (`/`, `/=`)
- Multiplication (`*`, `*=`)
- Exponent (`**`)
- Modulus (`%`, `%=`)

## Using let

```bash
x=2
# x++ # Error: x++ command not found
let x++ # Using let will allow you to perform it
echo $x
```
> `3`

- Different ways to perform calculation
```bash
x=2
y=3

z=$((x+y))
echo $z

let z=$((x+y))
echo $z

z="$((x+y))"
echo $z

let z="$((x+y))"
echo $z
```
> `5` \
> `5` \
> `5` \
> `5`

## Using backtick & expr
```bash
a=2
b=3
c=`expr $a + $b`
echo $c
```
> `5`


# If statement

- Need a space after `if`, `[` and before `]`
- Only handful of operators can be used in `[ ]`
- You can use `<` inside `[ ]` however it must be escaped by `\` to stop it
  acting as redirection operator.
- Recommendations:
  - Use bash keywords style operator (`lt`, `le`, `ge`, `gt`, `eq`, `ne`) inside `[ ]`
  - or use `(( ))`

```bash
x=2
y=3

if [ $x == 2 ] && [ $y == 3 ]; then
  echo "Value of x is 2 and y is 3"
elif [ $x == 2 ]; then
  echo "Value of x is 2 and y is 3"
else
  echo "Values of x and y are not valid"
fi
```
> `Value of x is 2 and y is 3`

- Same if condition in different style
```bash
if [ $x \< $y ]; then
  echo "Value of x is less than y"
fi

if [ "$x" \< "$y" ]; then
  echo "Value of x is less than y"
fi

if [ $x -le $y ]; then
  echo "Value of x is less than y"
fi

if [ "$x" -le "$y" ]; then
  echo "Value of x is less than y"
fi

if (( $x < $y )); then
  echo "Value of x is less than y"
fi
```

- Using builtin operators for number comparisons
```bash
[[ 2 -eq 2 ]] && echo "Both numbers are equal"
[[ 2 -ne 5 ]] && echo "Both numbers are different"
[[ 2 -lt 6 ]] && echo "First number is less than second number"
[[ 2 -le 7 ]] && echo "First number is less than/equal second number"
[[ 9 -gt 8 ]] && echo "First number is greater than second number"
[[ 9 -ge 9 ]] && echo "First number is greater than/equal second number"
```
> `Both numbers are equal` \
`Both numbers are different` \
`First number is less than second number` \
`First number is less than/equal second number` \
`First number is greater than second number` \
`First number is greater than/equal second number`


# Switch statement

```bash
x=7
case $x in
3)
    echo "x is having value 3"
    ;;
4 | 5 | 6 | 7)  # Specifying multiple options
    echo "x is having value b/w 4..7"
    ;;
8)
    echo "x is having value 8"
    ;;
*)
    echo "x is having unknown value"
    ;;
esac
```
> `x is having value b/w 4..7`


# File validation

- Single line if condition

```bash
# -e can be used to check existence of a file or directory
[[ -e "/path/to/folder" ]]      && echo "Directory is there" || echo "Directory is not there"
[[ -e "/path/to/folder/or/file" ]] && echo "File is there"      || echo "File is not there"

# -f can be only be used to check existence of a file
[[ -f "/path/to/folder" ]]      && echo "Directory is there" || echo "Directory is not there"
[[ -f "/path/to/folder/or/file" ]] && echo "File is there"      || echo "File is not there"
[[ -f "/path/to/folder/or/file" ]] || echo "File is not there"
[[ -f "/path/to/folder/or/file" ]] || { echo "File is not there"; exit 1; }

# Use -d for directory
[[ -d "/path/to/folder" ]]      && echo "Directory is there" || echo "Directory is not there"
[[ -d "/path/to/folder/or/file" ]] && echo "File is there"      || echo "File is not there"

# Validation of file path
[[ -r "/path/to/folder/or/file" ]] && echo "File is readable"   || echo "File is not readable"
[[ -w "/path/to/folder/or/file" ]] && echo "File is writable"   || echo "File is not writable"
[[ -x "/path/to/folder/or/file" ]] && echo "File is executable" || echo "File is not executable"
[[ -s "/path/to/folder/or/file" ]] && echo "File size >0 bytes" || echo "File size is of 0 bytes"
[[ -h "/path/to/folder/or/file" ]] && echo "File is symblink"   || echo "File is not symlink"

# File comparison
[[ "/path/to/file1" -nt "/path/to/file2" ]] && echo "file1 is more recent than file22"
[[ "/path/to/file1" -ot "/path/to/file2" ]] && echo "file2 is more recent than 1"
[[ "/path/to/file1" -ef "/path/to/file2" ]] && echo "file1 & file2 are the same files"
```

- using multi-line if condition

```bash
if test -f /path/to/file; then
  echo "File is there"
fi

if ! test -f /path/to/file; then
  echo "File does not exist"
fi

if ! [ -f /path/to/file ]; then
  echo "File does not exist."
fi

```


# Compound statement
- second part of the command after `;` will not be executed
```bash
[ -f test.txt ] && echo "first command"; cat "second command";
```

- use compound statement to execute multiple commands
```bash
[ -f sample.txt ] && { echo "first command"; cat "second command"; }
```


# Loops

- while loop (for ever)
```bash
while true; do echo "hello"; sleep 2; done
```

- while loop
```bash
a=1
while [[ $a -le 5 ]]; do
    echo "While loop idx # $a"
    let ++a
done
```
> `While loop idx # 1` \
`While loop idx # 2` \
`While loop idx # 3` \
`While loop idx # 4` \
`While loop idx # 5`

- For loop with defined range and custom increment
```bash
for i in {1..10..2}; do
    echo "loop # $i with step @ 2"
done
```
> `loop # 1 with step @ 2` \
`loop # 3 with step @ 2` \
`loop # 5 with step @ 2` \
`loop # 7 with step @ 2` \
`loop # 9 with step @ 2`


- For loop c-style
```bash
for ((i = 1 ; i <= 10 ; i++)); do
  echo "c-style loop # $i with step @ 1"
done
```
> `c-style loop # 1 with step @ 1` \
`c-style loop # 2 with step @ 1` \

`c-style loop # 9 with step @ 1` \
`c-style loop # 10 with step @ 1`


- For loop in c-style
```bash
for ((i = 1 ; i <= 10 ; i += 2)); do
  echo "c-style loop # $i with step @ 2"
done
```
> `c-style loop # 1 with step @ 2` \
`c-style loop # 3 with step @ 2` \
`c-style loop # 5 with step @ 2` \
`c-style loop # 7 with step @ 2` \
`c-style loop # 9 with step @ 2`


- For loop with seq expression
```bash
for i in `seq 1 5`; do
  echo "loop with seq expr # $i"
done
```
> `loop with seq expr # 1` \
`loop with seq expr # 2` \
`loop with seq expr # 3` \
`loop with seq expr # 4` \
`loop with seq expr # 5`


- `for` loop to iterate over word list
```bash
words="word1 word2 word3"
for word in $words; do
  echo "$word"
done
```
> `word1` \
`word2` \
`word3`

```bash
for word in word1 word2 word3; do echo "$word"; done
```

"
for word in $words; do
  echo "$word"
done
```
> `word1` \
`word2` \
`word3` \
`word4` \
`word5`


# String manipulation
## Length

- Length of a string
```bash
str="string"
echo "${#str}"
```
> `6`


## Slicing
- String can be sliced down from front as well from backward. Format will be `${string:position:length}`.

- Extract string starting from the specified character position to the end of the string.
```bash
str="1234567890"
echo "${str:6}"
```
> `7890`

- Extract string starting from the specified character position to the start of the string.
```bash
str="1234567890"
echo "${str:(-6)}"
```
> `567890`

- Extract string starting from the specified character position to the specified number of characters.
```bash
str="1234567890"
echo "${str:6:4}"
```
> `7890`

- Extract string starting from the specified character position to the specified number of characters.
```
str="1234567890"
echo "${str:(-6):3}"
```
> `567`

- Extract specified number characters starting from the string.
```bash
str="1234567890"
echo "${str::3}"
```
> `123`

- Extract string starting from the specified character from the backwards to the start of the string.
```bash
str="1234567890"
echo "${str::-3}"
```
> `1234567`


## Concatenate
```bash
str="string1"
str+=" string2"
str="${str} string3"
echo "${str}"
```
> `string1 string2 string3`


## Changing case

- Convert whole string into uppercase
```bash
str=bash
echo "${str^^}"
```
> `BASH`

- Convert first character to uppercase
```bash
str=bash
echo "${str^}"
```
> `Bash`

- Convert whole string into lowercase
```bash
str=BASH
echo "${str,,}"
```
> `bash`


```bash
str=BASH
echo "${str,}"
```
> `bASH`

- Reverse the each character of the string
```bash
str=baSH
echo "${str~~}"
```
> `BAsh`

- Reverse the first character of the string
```bash
str=baSH
echo "${str~}"
```
> `BaSH`


## Comparison
- Bash if condition with `==`, `!=` can be used for case sensitive comparison.

```bash
str="string"
if [ "${str}" == "string" ]; then
    echo "Both strings are equal"
fi

if [ "${str}" != "String" ]; then
    echo "Both strings are different"
fi
```
> `Both strings are equal` \
`Both strings are different`

- String comparison using single line if statements
```bash
[[ "bash" == "bash" ]] && echo "String are equal" || echo "String are not equal"
[[ "bash" != "bash" ]] && echo "String not equal" || echo "String are equal"
```
> `String are not equal` \
`String are equal`

See [Compound statement](#compound-statement)

```bash
# You can skip any part
[[ "bash" == "bash" ]] && echo "String are equal"
[[ "bash" != "bash" ]] || echo "String are equal"
```
> `String are not equal` \
`String are equal`


## Substitution
For pattern, look for https://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/pattern

- `${PARAMETER/PATTERN/STRING}` - replace first occurrence
- `${PARAMETER//PATTERN/STRING}` - replace all occurrences
- `${PARAMETER/PATTERN}` - remove first occurrence of pattern
- `${PARAMETER//PATTERN}` - remove all occurrences of pattern

```bash
str="Bash, hello world! Bash, hello world!"
echo ${str//l/L} # Replace l with L
echo ${str//world} # Remove world
```
> `Bash, heLLo worLd! Bash, heLLo worLd!` \
`Bash, hello ! Bash, hello !`

- If $substring matches front end of $string, substitute $replacement for $substring.
```bash
str="test hello world test"
echo ${str/#test/L}
```
> `L hello world test`

- If $substring matches back end of $string, substitute $replacement for $substring.
```bash
str="test hello world test"
echo ${str/%test/L}
```
> `test hello world L`

- Remove prefix
```bash
str="test hello world test"
echo ${str/#test}
```
> `hello world test`

- Remove suffix
```bash
str="test hello world test"
echo ${str/%test}
```
> `test hello world`

- Remove long suffix
```bash
${VAR%%suffix}
```

- Remove long prefix
```bash
${VAR##prefix}
```


# Using builtin `-z` and `-n` operator

## For string

```bash
str="bash"
[[ -z $str ]] && echo "string is empty" || echo "string is not empty"
```
> `string is not empty`

```bash
str=""
[[ -z $str ]] && echo "string is empty" || echo "string is not empty"
```
> `string is empty`

```bash
str="bash"
[[ -n $str ]] && echo "string is not empty" || echo "string is empty"
```
> `string is not empty`

```bash
str="bash"
[[ -n $str ]] && echo "string is not empty" || echo "string is empty"
```
> `string is empty`


## For variables
```bash
a=0
if [ -n "$a" ]; then
  echo "a is set (Using -n)"
else
  echo "a is not set (Using -n)"
fi

# b=0
if [ -n "$b" ]; then
  echo "b is set (Using -n)"
else
  echo "b is not set (Using -n)"
fi
```
> `a is set (Using -n)` \
`b is not set (Using -n)`


```bash
x=0
if [ -z "$x" ]; then
  echo "x is empty (Using -z)"
else
  echo "x is not empty (Using -z)"
fi

# y=0
if [ -z "$y" ]; then
  echo "y is empty (Using -z)"
else
  echo "y is not empty (Using -z)"
fi
```
> `x is not empty (Using -z)` \
`y is empty (Using -z)`


# File path manipulation

```bash
path="/path/to/file.ext"
echo "                  ${path}"
echo "Path + File Name: ${path%.ext}"
echo "Path:             ${path%/*.*}"
echo "File Name + ext:  ${path##*/}"
echo "Extension:        ${path##*.}"
```
> `                  /path/to/file.ext` \
`Path + File Name: /path/to/file` \
`Path:             /path/to` \
`File Name + ext:  file.ext` \
`Extension:        ext`

## `${parameter:-word}`
```bash
var=10
echo ${var:-20} # Use 20; if var is not set or null
```
> 10

```bash
echo ${var:-20} # Use 20 as var is null
```
> 20

```bash
var=
echo ${var:-20} # Use 20 as var is null
```
> 20

## `${parameter-word}`
```bash
echo ${var-20} # Use 20 as var is not declared
```
> 20

```bash
var=
echo ${var-20} # 20 will not be used as var is declared
```
>

NOTE: `${var:-20}` vs `${var:20}` - Funtionality wise both are same. `:` is forcing to set the value by `20` even if variable is declared but no value is being assigned.

# Invoking script
- Invoking another script (as a separate process) from within script
- As new script is a separate process so envrionment modifications
  done for the current script won't be visible to the new script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
./script.sh
# - or -
/path/to/script.sh
# - or -
/bin/bash script.sh
```

- Invoking another script with in the process
- Now envrionment modification will be visisble to the new script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
. ./script.sh
# - or -
. /path/to/script.sh
# - or -
source script.sh
```


# Random number
- Generate 32 characters having a-z, A-Z, 0-9
```bash
cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | head -c 32
```
- Generate a number between 0-999
```bash
cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc '0-9' | fold -w3 | head -n1
```
Use `-w3` of fold command to control of number of digits in a number.

- Generate numbers between ranges
```bash
shuf -i 100-250 -n 10
shuf -i 100-250 -n 10 --random-source /dev/urandom
```
Generate numbers b/w 100-250.


# Function
```bash
function foo() {
  ...
}
```

- `foo` a simple function which grouped a number of statements and to call it simply type `foo`.
- `function` keyboard prior to `foo` is optional.

## Passing arugments to funtions
- `funa` is a function which takes any number of parameters and print those.

```bash
function funa() {
  echo "funa is passed $# params"
  for i in "$@"; do
    echo "param value is $i";
  done
}
```

```bash
funa
```
> `funa is passed 0 params`

```bash
funa 1
```
> `funa is passed 1 params` \
`param value is 1`

```bash
funa 1 2
```
> `funa is passed 2 params` \
`param value is 1` \
`param value is 2`

```bash
funa 1 2 3
```
> `funa is passed 3 params` \
`param value is 1` \
`param value is 2` \
`param value is 3`

## Return value from function
```bash
funb() {
  local param1=$1
  local param2=$2
  local result=$param1+$param2
  echo $result
}
```

- `echo` command of `funb` will print message on conole
```bash
funb "a" "b"
```
> `a+b`

- Capture it to a variable
```bash
output=$(funb "c" "d")
echo "Output: $output"
```
> `Output: c+d`

## return statement in function
If function is not having any return statement, exit status of the last command of the function will be returned. You can use `return` statement to provided specific return value. It can be upto 0 to 255.

```bash
funa() {
	return 1
}
funa
echo $?
```
> `1`

```bash
funb() {
	return 110
}
funb
echo $?
```
> `110`

```
fund() {
	echo "Hello"
}
fund
echo $?
```
> `Hello` \
`0`


[Different style of functions](https://gist.github.com/aakbar5/9ac8073f30965c6d138b041dfc4d69a8)


# Global and local variables
Variables are global by nature.


## Usage # 1
```bash
var=10
function test() {
  var=20 # Global var has been modified
  echo "var in test = $var"
}

test
echo "var in main = $var"
```

Output:
> `var in test = 20` \
`var in main = 20`


## Usage # 2

```bash
var=10
function test() {
  local var=20 # Global var will retain its value
               # A var has been created which is local to this function
  echo "var in test = $var"
}

test
echo "var in main = $var"
```

Output:
> `var in test = 20` \
`var in main = 10`


## Usage # 3
```bash
func() {
  VAR1='A'
  local VAR2='B'

  echo "func: Variable VAR1: $VAR1"
  echo "func: Variable VAR2: $VAR2"
}

fund() {
  VAR3='C'
  echo "fund: Variable VAR3: $VAR3"

  # Although VAR1 is declared in func but still fund can see
  # because variable in bash are global in nature not matter
  # where you are defining it
  echo "fund: Variable VAR1: $VAR1"

  # As VAR2 is defined using local so fund can't access it
  echo "fund: Variable VAR2: $VAR2"
}

# Call functions
func
fund
```

> `func: Variable VAR1: A` \
`func: Variable VAR2: B` \
`fund: Variable VAR3: C` \
`fund: Variable VAR1: A` \
`fund: Variable VAR2:`


# Argument handling
- getopts is a built-in Unix command to parse arguments.
[`getopts` usage](https://gist.github.com/aakbar5/e2cf511c5844929afc849cf0fda46296)

  - If `:` is not found at the start of the argument list, `getopts` does not perform any error checking. Otherwise error will be reported on having unkown option or paramter.
  - `getopts` does not handle long options (`--long`). `getopt` can do the job however it is not built-in functionality of the Bourne shell.

# Read a file
```bash
FILE='test.txt'
while read LINE; do
  echo $LINE
done < $FILE
```
